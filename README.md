# Ceremo-Venue-Reservation-System

## Problem

Many community centers and restaurants that offer ceremonial spaces face significant challenges in managing reservations.  
The traditional, often manual methods of handling bookings are prone to errors such as:
  
- Miscommunications  
- Scheduling conflicts  

For customers, the lack of an online system means:

- No real-time availability  
- Inconvenience of physically visiting venues  
- Repetitive phone calls to secure a booking  

This fragmented approach frustrates users and reduces operational efficiency and potential revenue for the venues.
